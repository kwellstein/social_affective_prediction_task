The monado_metrics.pb.c and monado_metrics.pb.h files were copied directly
from Monado source code path monado/src/external/nanopb/monado_metrics.pb.*
as of commit f66d60cb2cb7c1cf2972c728d847680344e2a07c

The source code of the Monado OpenXR runtime can be found at the following URL:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado.git

The files were likely auto-generated via nanopb from the here included protocol
spec file monado_metrics.proto, which seems to come from the Monado metrics tool
repository at:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/utilities/metrics
