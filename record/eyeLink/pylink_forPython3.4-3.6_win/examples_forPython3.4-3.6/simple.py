# DESCRIPTION:
# simple.py demonstrates minimal Pylink code required to connect, setup, 
# control and use an EyeLink eyetracker to record and access eyemovement.
# In order to eliminate dependency on third party display software like Pygame, 
# this example does not demonstrate use of any visual stimuli during trials. 
# The experiment is made up of three trials that start with a drift correction 
# screen followed by a five-second blank screen.
#
# This Pylink code demonstrates the following steps:
# 1-initializing connection to the tracker
# 2-initializing display-side graphics
# 3-initializing data file
# 4-setting up tracking, recording and calibration options 
# 5-launching experiment display (run_trials)
# 6-initial tracker calibration (run_trials)
# 7-running individual trial (do_trial)
# 8-verify connection to tracker and do drift correction 
#   while checking if recalibration is needed (do_trial)
# 9-start actual recording of samples and events to the data file 
#   and send both over the link (do_trial)
# 10-enter realtime mode and mark trial start time (do_trial)
# 11-stub to insert code that loads the initial visual stimulus (do_trial)
# 12-mark the time initial visual stimulus came on relative 
#   to the trial start time in the data file (do_trial)
# 13-wait and make sure we get the start signal for link samples 
#   then mark which eye is being tracked (do_trial)
# 14-flush outstanding input from response box (do_trial)
# 15-pole for newest sample over the link while verifying that tracker
#   is still recording, that termination or setup have not been requested 
#   and that the trial time has not yet exceeded the predefined trial duration (do_trial)
# 16-end realtime mode, stop recording and consume pending key presses (end_trial)
# 17-record mock trial result to data file (do_trial)
# 18-set offline,close and transfer data file from host to display pc
# 19-close eyelink connection and quit display-side graphics
